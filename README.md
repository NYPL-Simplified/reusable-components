## Library Simplified Documentation

To see screenshots, read in-depth documentation, and find out more about the project, check out the [Confluence](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/) site hosted by The New York Public Library.

To find documentation for the components in this repo (a work in progress), find it on our [Storybook documentation page](https://nypl-simplified.github.io/reusable-components).

## npm package

This package is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/library-simplified-reusable-components).

The `library-simplified-reusable-components` components is currently used in the Circulation Admin and the Registry Admin imported through npm. If you want to import the React components into your app, simply run `npm install --save library-simplified-reusable-components`.

### Publishing

To publish a new version, you need to have an npm account and be a collaborator on the package. Once a new feature or update has been merged into `master`, then you can run `npm publish` locally to publish a new version. Make sure it is on the `master` branch and that `package.json` is updated accordingly.

## Tests

Like the codebase, all the unit tests are written in Typescript. Tests are written for all React components and can be found in the `__tests__` folder.

To run the tests, perform `npm test`.

We use Travis CI for continuous integration. Any pull requests submitted must have tests and those tests must pass on Travis CI.

## Storybook

We are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document the React components found in this package.

To run Storybook locally, run `npm run storybook` and the Storybook server will start and go to localhost:6006 automatically. Any changes to the stories files under `/stories` will hot reload.

### Github Pages

You can build and deploy a static version of the Storybook documentation _without_ having to commit and push changes to master. This is not recommended as the documentation can then be ahead of the `master` branch. Once a feature branch or any updates are merged into `master`, it is recommended to _then_ deploy the static build of the Storybook documentation. This can be done by running `npm run deploy-storybook`. If you have access to the Github repo, the `gh-pages` branch will automatically be updated and you can view updates on [Github](https://nypl-simplified.github.io/reusable-components/).
