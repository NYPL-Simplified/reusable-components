#### Use npm version

If you're working on one of the administrative interface and want to import reusable components from this repository:

Instructions TBA!

Webpack will take care of compiling and updating any new changes made locally for development.

## Publishing

<!-- This package is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplified-reusable-components). -->

To publish a new version, you need to create an npm account and be a collaborator on the package. Then you can run `npm publish` from your local copy of the repository.

## Tests

Like the codebase, all the unit tests are written in Typescript. Tests are written for all React components as well as redux and utility functions, and all can be found in their respective `__tests__` folders.

To run the tests, perform `npm test`.

We use Travis CI for continuous integration. Any pull requests submitted must have tests and those tests must pass on Travis CI.
